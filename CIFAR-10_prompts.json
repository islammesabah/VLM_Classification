    "Please classify the object in the given image. It should be only one of these classes: {class_names_str}. Please generate only the class ID number.",
    "Kindly proceed to classify the entity depicted within the presented imagery. The classification must adhere strictly to the following enumerated categories: {class_names_str}. It is imperative that your response comprises solely the numerical identifier corresponding to the class. Ensure precision in your classification endeavor.",
    "Hey there! Can you help me figure out what's in this picture? It's got to be one of these: {class_names_str}. Just a heads up, I only need the class ID number. Thanks a bunch!",
    "Examine the image provided closely. You are tasked with identifying the specific category to which the object depicted belongs. This classification must align with one of the following distinct classes: {class_names_str}. Each class corresponds to a unique ID number ranging from 0 to 9, which captures a specific type of common object, described in rich detail to aid in accurate identification:\n\n- Class 0: Look for images featuring commercial or military airplanes mid-flight, with clear views of wings, engines, and tail structures against the backdrop of the sky.\n- Class 1: Identify passenger vehicles, such as sedans and hatchbacks, showcasing their full bodies, wheels, and windshields, situated within urban or roadside environments.\n- Class 2: Spot images of small perching birds or waterfowl, characterized by their visible beaks, wings, and legs, set against natural landscapes.\n- Class 3: Seek out domestic cats captured in various poses, highlighting their triangular ears, distinct whisk",
    "Classify the image into one of the following classes: {class_names_str}. Output the class ID only.",
    "Let's begin by examining the given image closely. First, determine if the image depicts a form of transportation or an animal. If it's transportation, decide whether it's airborne, on land, or at sea. For airborne, look for wings, engines, and tail structures to identify if it's a commercial or military airplane (class 0). On land, distinguish between passenger vehicles with wheels and windshields (class 1) and commercial trucks with separate cabs and trailers (class 9). At sea, identify water vessels by their hulls and masts to decide if it's a sailboat or cargo ship (class 8).\n\nIf the image features an animal, note the environment and physical characteristics. Birds (class 2) will have beaks, wings, and legs, often against natural backgrounds. Cats (class 3) are recognized by triangular ears, whiskers, and fur patterns, usually indoors. Deer (class 4) appear in woodland settings with. Classes are {class_names_str}. Output the class ID number.",
    "Given an image, your task is to identify the specific category it belongs to, considering the unique characteristics and environment associated with each. The possible categories are {class_names_str}. Your response should be concise, limited to the class ID number that best matches the observed features and setting of the image.",
    "Estimate the likelihood of the object in the image belonging to one of the following classes: {class_names_str}. Provide the class ID number that you are most confident represents the object in the image, ensuring accuracy in your selection.",
    "Imagine you're a detective analyzing an image for a clue. Your task is to identify the central object in the picture, but the only hints you can use are these code names: {class_names_str}. Examine the scene carefully and report back with just the code number of the object you've uncovered.",
    "Kindly proceed to categorize the entity depicted within the provided imagery. It is imperative that the classification aligns exclusively with one of the enumerated classes, specifically: {class_names_str}. Subsequently, furnish solely the class identification numeral as your response."
