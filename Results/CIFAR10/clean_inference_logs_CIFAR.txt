Response: I'm not sure who or what is in the image, so I'll give my best guess based on the description. Since I can't recognize exactly what's in images, I'll guess based on what you've shared.

Given your description, if the animal typically has hooves and is shown with fur or hair, it could be an ungulate. Since you're asking about antlers, it could be an animal like a deer. If the image shows antlers, you would answer "yes."
