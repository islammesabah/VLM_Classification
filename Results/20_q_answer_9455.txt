Let's play the Yes/No 20 Question Game! I'll ask simple visual questions to try to classify the street sign.

Here's my first question:

1. Is the sign primarily circular in shape?

(Please respond with a simple "yes" or "no")
---------- vision ----------
Yes.
---------- player ----------
That helps to narrow it down! Here's my next question:

2. Is the sign red and white in color?

(Please respond with a simple "yes" or "no")
---------- vision ----------
No.
---------- player ----------
That helps to rule out some possibilities. Here's my next question:

3. Does the sign contain any arrows or direction indicators (e.g. ↑, ↓, ←, →)?

(Please respond with a simple "yes" or "no")
---------- vision ----------
Yes.
---------- player ----------
That's a useful clue! Here's my next question:

4. Are the arrows or direction indicators pointing in a forward direction (e.g. ↑ or →)?

(Please respond with a simple "yes" or "no")
---------- vision ----------
No.
---------- player ----------
That helps to narrow it down. Here's my next question:

5. Does the sign contain a blue color?

(Please respond with a simple "yes" or "no")
---------- vision ----------
Yes.
---------- player ----------
That's a strong clue! Here's my next question:

6. Is the sign a mandatory direction sign (i.e. does it indicate a required direction or action)?

(Please respond with a simple "yes" or "no")
---------- vision ----------
Yes.
---------- player ----------
That helps a lot! Here's my next question:

7. Does the sign contain a single arrow or direction indicator (e.g. ← or ↑)?

(Please respond with a simple "yes" or "no")
---------- vision ----------
Yes.
---------- player ----------
That's a good clue! Based on your answers, I'm going to take a guess:

I think the class of the image is "33": "blue circle with white right turn arrow mandatory".

Is that correct?

(Please respond with a simple "yes" or "no")
---------- vision ----------
No.
---------- player ----------
I was close, but not quite there.

Let me ask some more questions to try to get it right.

8. Does the sign contain a left turn arrow (←)?

(Please respond with a simple "yes" or "no")
---------- vision ----------
No.
---------- player ----------
That helps to rule out some possibilities. Here's my next question:

9. Does the sign contain an upward arrow (↑)?

(Please respond with a simple "yes" or "no")
---------- vision ----------
No.
---------- player ----------
That helps to narrow it down. Here's my next question:

10. Does the sign contain a right turn arrow () that is pointing to the right and slightly downward?

(Please respond with a simple "yes" or "no")
---------- vision ----------
Yes.
---------- player ----------
I think I can make an educated guess now!

Based on your answers, I'm going to take a guess:

I think the class of the image is "34": "blue circle with white left turn arrow mandatory".

Wait, no... you said it's a right turn arrow, not left!

I think the class of the image is actually "36": "blue circle with white forward or right turn arrow mandatory".

Am I correct this time?

(Please respond with a simple "yes" or "no")
---------- vision ----------
Yes.
---------- player ----------
Yay! I'm glad I was able to guess it correctly!

The class of the image is indeed "36": "blue circle with white forward or right turn arrow mandatory".

I'm going to APPROVE this result.
